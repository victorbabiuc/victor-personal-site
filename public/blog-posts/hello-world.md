# Hello World! I'm Victor

I built this website and blog with AI specifically [Claude](https://claude.ai) and [Cursor](https://cursor.sh). I've been deep diving into "vibe coding" (coding by feel/intuition with AI assistance) and have managed to get two small apps in the app store.

During the day, I'm a technology recruiter, partnering with startups and cutting-edge companies to build winning teams that will transform the world. I love connecting with entrepreneurs and have written small checks for a few startups. For the right seed-stage startup, I'm always excited to learn more and potentially invest.

I hope to periodically contribute to this blog and describe what passion projects I'm working on.

Aside from 'vibe coding' I'm also interested in plants, with my prized possession being a variegated [albo monstera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstera_deliciosa), but recently I've been getting into succulents and cacti.

In addition, I'm practicing [JiuJitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu), continually trying to teach my dog Ruby new tricks, and soaking up as much Florida sunshine as possible.

I'm always on the lookout for new travel destinations. Fun fact: I've circled the globe once. If you have any recommendations of places that have a rich history and incredible food - [drop me a line](mailto:glootieapp@gmail.com).

Staying curious! Always learning, always building, always exploring.
